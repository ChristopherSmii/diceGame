This is a game for 2 players.
Each player will take turns to roll a die,
the winner is the one who's not going to reach 0.

note:
Note 1.
The challenge gives us a starting HTML and CSS file..
That being said I plan on building everything on my own.

Note 2.
I plan on building something even better.
I saw an interesting dice game online.
